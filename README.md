# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, lot size, number of rooms, and other attributes. The dataset used for this project is the `HousePricePrediction.xlsx` file, which contains detailed data about houses, including both numeric and categorical variables.

The goal is to preprocess the data, explore key patterns, and build a predictive model that can estimate house prices accurately.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dataset Exploration and Cleaning**

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Identify categorical and numerical features for preprocessing.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

- One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Standardization or normalization of numerical features.
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

### 3. **Data Visualization**

- Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features.
- Distribution plots for numerical columns.
- Count plots for categorical features.

### 4. **Modeling**

- Build and evaluate machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-Squared to evaluate model performance.

### 5. **Deployment**

- The final model can be exported and integrated into a user-facing application for live predictions.

## Requirements

### **Python Libraries**

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.

3. Install the required dependencies (see the Requirements section).

4. Place the `HousePricePrediction.xlsx` file in the project directory.

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Updated_version_1.2.ipynb
   ```

6. Follow the step-by-step workflow in the notebook to preprocess the data, visualize patterns, and build predictive models.

## Project Workflow

1. **Load the Dataset**

   - Import and inspect the data using `pandas`.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   - Handle missing values and convert categorical variables to numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Use plots and statistical methods to explore the data.

4. **Model Development**

   - Train machine learning models and optimize them using cross-validation.

5. **Evaluation**

   - Evaluate models on test data and select the best-performing model.

## Results and Insights

- **Correlation Heatmap:** Identifies features that strongly influence house prices.
- **Model Performance:** The best-performing model achieves an R-squared value of X and an MSE of Y (replace with actual results).
- **Feature Importance:** Highlights key features contributing to price prediction.

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
- Include additional features (e.g., economic indicators, crime rates).
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
